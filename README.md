## Built With

- Languages: _**python**_ is a beginner-friendly and powerful programming language that's widely used in automation data analysis and web development. In testing Python makes it easy       to write clean and readable automation scripts. Especially when combined with tools like Selenium.
- Frameworks: _**selenium**_ is an open-source tool used for automating web browsers. It allows you to write scripts that interact with web applications just like a real user clicking      buttons entering text or verifying content‚Äîmaking it ideal for UI testing.
- Technologies used: _**GIT, GITHUB, WebDriver**_

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Automation
1. Make sure Python is installed
     - You can check by running:
``` python --version```

2. Install Selenium
     - Run this command in your terminal or command prompt:  
     ```pip install selenium```
3. Run the script
     -  In your terminal, run:
```python todo_test.py```

ü§î Assumptions Made
1. The To-Do app is a simple HTML page opened from your local machine

2. The element IDs and class names are consistent with the ones in the script:

  - Input box has id="new-todo"

  - Add button has id="add-button"

  - Tasks are listed under id="todo-list"

3. Checkbox and delete button are added dynamically

4. Chrome browser and ChromeDriver are installed and compatible
